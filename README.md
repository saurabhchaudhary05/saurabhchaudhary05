Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills by solving problems on LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank. I'm also exploring projects in machine learning and data analysis!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced algorithms, software development practices, and data analysis. Recently, I've been diving into machine learning and database management to build a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to DSA, machine learning, or full-stack web development. Iâ€™m also open to contributing to any project where I can learn something new.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with complex algorithms and understanding the best practices in ML model deployment. If you have experience in these areas, I'd love to connect!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding challenges, the basics of machine learning, or projects involving data analysis. I also enjoy discussing academic resources and study strategies!
